It was late at night. 
Too late for anyone to be thinking straight. 
But there the player was scrolling through the internet, bored.
A pop up appeared on the screen. Persistent in its bright text to get the player to click.
The player considered it for a few seconds. Passing like minutes in their sleep addled brain.
Clicking on it, the game only posed one question.
Would you like to play?
They clicked yes.
